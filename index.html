    <p>Information About me

        I enjoy spending time drawing, playing video games and collecting. I wish to further my talent of drawing into
        creating concept art for various forms of media.
<br>

        What do you wish to do after this year?
        I wish to go into college for concept art. In meaning various forms of media movies, games, shows etc. The
        concepts range from characters, landscapes, towns, cities, weapons, monsters and a whole bunch more.
<br>
        What are some of your academic achievements? I have received multiple A honors and B honors from CTE, the
        technical highschool I attended. Throughout my highschool career I have had perfect attendance. I am a
        recognized web designer apprentice earning the CWDSA designation from the WebProfessionals organization.
<br>

        I plan on working more on character concepts along with concepts for many other things. At the end of this year
        I hope to obtain a scholarship from my main school for perfect attendance for my highschool career.
